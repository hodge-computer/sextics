# A relative primitive for the symmetric sextic

## Target and draft status

Put \(Q_X=X_0X_1+X_0X_2+X_1X_2\) and
\(Q_Y=Y_0Y_1+Y_0Y_2+Y_1Y_2\). The fixed target is
\[
F=\sum_{i=0}^2(X_i^6+Y_i^6)
 +\frac57Q_X^2Q_Y+\frac{10}{7}Q_XQ_Y^2,
\qquad A=X_0X_1X_2Y_0Y_1Y_2,\qquad q=1.
\]
This is an **incomplete proof draft**. The algebra below reduces the target
to a relative rational primitive and a final transport step. The two
unfinished lemmas in [Solution](Solution.lean) are identified below; its
`Submission.certificate` is not a verified certificate.

## Reflection chart and residue

Use the chart
\[
X=(1+v,1-v,b),\qquad
Y=(c+\lambda v,c-\lambda v,d).
\]
The substituted equation is \(H=f(\lambda,b,c,d,v^2)\), with \(f\) the exact
`rawWeighted` polynomial in
[WeightedPrimitiveTransportCore](WeightedPrimitiveTransportCore.lean).
Writing
\[
P=b d(1-u)(c^2-\lambda^2u),
\]
the transformed source coefficient is \(A_H=4vP|_{u=v^2}\).
[SymmetricAffineJacobian](SymmetricAffineJacobian.lean) checks the full
six-coordinate map \((a,\lambda,b,c,d,v)\mapsto(aX,aY)\), its determinant
\(4a^5v\), and the sixth-power scaling of \(F\) and \(A\).
The projective source coefficient is consequently \(A_H/H^2\).

[SymmetricAffinePrime](SymmetricAffinePrime.lean) proves \(H\) irreducible.
[SymmetricAffineField](SymmetricAffineField.lean) constructs the function field
\(K=\operatorname{Frac}(\mathbb C[\lambda,b,c,d,v]/(H))\).
The point \((0,0,0,0,i)\) has \(H=0\) and \(H_v=-48i\), proving that
\(g=H_v\) is nonzero in \(K\). Hence the canonical tangent derivatives
\(E_j=\partial_j-(H_j/H_v)\partial_v\), for
\(j\in\{\lambda,b,c,d\}\), are defined on the actual chart field.

The relative residue density is
\[
\rho=\left.\frac{2(f_uP_u-f_{uu}P)}{f_u^3}\right|_{u=v^2}.
\]
The needed two-form is
\[
\beta=\beta_0\,dc\wedge dd-\beta_1\,db\wedge dd
       +\beta_2\,db\wedge dc,
\qquad E_b\beta_0+E_c\beta_1+E_d\beta_2=\rho.
\]
[SymmetricPrimitiveEndpoint](SymmetricPrimitiveEndpoint.lean) packages these
three elements of \(K\) and their equation as `RelativePrimitive`.

## Conditional clearing and the certificate

Given such a primitive,
[WeightedPrimitiveTransport](WeightedPrimitiveTransport.lean) constructs the
four-component current \(w=(0,-g\beta_0,-g\beta_1,-g\beta_2)\).
The product rule gives its weighted-divergence equation, without requiring
the coefficients to be independent of \(\lambda\).
Canonical residue clearing then supplies affine polynomial data
\(D,N_v,N_\lambda,N_b,N_c,N_d,Q\), with \(D\ne0\),
\(\gcd(H,D)=1\), and
\[
A_HD^2-D\left(N_vH_v+\sum_jN_jH_j\right)
 +H\left(D\operatorname{div}N-N\cdot\nabla D\right)=H^2Q.
\]
This is the conclusion of `clear_relative_primitive`; it is an affine result.

The final target requires transport back to the six original coordinates
and legal homogeneous data: a nonzero homogeneous denominator \(D\),
six numerators of degree \(\deg D+1\), coprimality with \(F\), and
\[
AD^2-D\sum_iN_iF_i
 +F\left(D\sum_i\partial_iN_i-\sum_iN_i\partial_iD\right)=F^2Q.
\]
The quotient \(Q\) is unrestricted. No expanded JSON witness is supplied.
[SymmetricRegularCurrent](SymmetricRegularCurrent.lean) proves that the
corresponding regular homogeneous current existence statement
`RegularGameExists` implies the literal protected target.

## Unfinished proof obligations

1. `Submission.relative_primitive_exists` must prove
   `Nonempty SymmetricPrimitiveEndpoint.RelativePrimitive`. The intended
   geometric route identifies the actual contact correspondence with the
   relevant cohomology map and proves support-to-function-field exactness.
   Contact identities and a finite rank calculation alone do not supply this
   implication. [ContactResidueAnnihilator](ContactResidueAnnihilator.lean)
   and [WeightedFiberSmoothness](WeightedFiberSmoothness.lean) provide
   supporting algebra and smoothness results, not primitive existence.
2. `Submission.regular_game_of_relative_primitive` must turn that primitive
   into `SymmetricRegularCurrent.RegularGameExists`, completing the
   affine-to-homogeneous transport. The chart and Jacobian identities do not
   themselves discharge this step.

Both lemmas remain admitted in the draft. The final theorem's assembly uses
them and therefore does not establish the protected certificate independently.

The intended geometric argument follows the project's
[weighted-threefold and two-reflection construction](../../docs/03b-weighted-threefolds.md),
which adapts Voisin's curve-correspondence method. The algebraic reductions use
the maintained HodgeComputer and HoldoutCover constructions and Mathlib.
